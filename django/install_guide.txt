So that the manage.py file's url is: C:\tweetanalyz\aml3406\manage.py

2. open cmd and browser to folder C:\tweetanalyz
(type cd c:\tweetanalyz)

3. Install virtual environment: python -m venv virt

where: 'virt' is the name of a folder contain environment; 'venv' is a python package for virtual environment
